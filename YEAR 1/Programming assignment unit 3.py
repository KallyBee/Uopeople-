Q2 :

denom = int(input(" Please Input Denominator :"))

numer = int(input( " Please input Numerator :"))



if numer == 0:

    print(" Can't divide by zero")

   

else :

    answer = denom / numer

    print(answer)



#Explanation : if you allow the user to divide by zero it will create a runtime error, which is not user â€“ friendly that is why we need to catch the error to make it user friendly.
